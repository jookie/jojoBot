# how to install requirements.txt

1. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   Open your terminal or command prompt and change to the directory where your `requirements.txt` file is located. You can use the `cd` command to change directories.

   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/project
   ```

2. **Ensure Virtual Environment is Activated:**
   It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage your project's dependencies. You can activate your virtual environment using:

   - **For macOS/Linux:**
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

   If you haven't created a virtual environment, you can create one with:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Install Packages:**
   Run the following command to install all the packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This command will read the `requirements.txt` file and install all the packages specified within it [[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7225900/how-can-i-install-packages-using-pip-according-to-the-requirements-txt-file-from)][[2](https://note.nkmk.me/en/python-pip-install-requirements/)].

4. **Verify Installation:**
   You can verify that the packages were installed correctly by listing installed packages:

   ```bash
   pip list
   ```

   This will show you all the packages that are currently installed in your environment.

Using `requirements.txt` allows for consistent environment setups across different systems, making it easier to share and deploy projects.

To collapse a cell in a Jupyter Notebook, you can follow these steps:

1. **Use the JupyterLab Interface**: If you are using JupyterLab, you can collapse a code cell by clicking the blue vertical bar that appears when you hover to the left of the cell. This feature is not available in classic Jupyter Notebook[[2](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/can-i-collapse-fold-cells-in-the-exported-html-file-from-a-notebook/8579)].

2. **Install nbextensions**: If you're using classic Jupyter Notebook, you can install `nbextensions`, which provides additional functionality, including the ability to collapse cells.
   - Install nbextensions using the following command:
     ```bash
     pip install jupyter_contrib_nbextensions
     jupyter contrib nbextension install --user
     ```
   - Once installed, open Jupyter Notebook, go to the "Nbextensions" tab, and enable "Collapsible Headings" or other relevant extensions.

3. **Use Keyboard Shortcuts**: In JupyterLab, you can also use keyboard shortcuts to collapse cells:
   - Select the cell you want to collapse.
   - Use `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `-` to collapse the cell.
   - Use `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `+` to expand the cell again.

rm -rf .git
git init
