2. **Ensure Virtual Environment is Activated:**
   It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage your project's dependencies. You can activate your virtual environment using:

   - **For macOS/Linux:**
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

   If you haven't created a virtual environment, you can create one with:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Install Packages:**
   Run the following command to install all the packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

   ```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
  
4. **Verify Installation:**
   You can verify that the packages were installed correctly by listing installed packages:

   ```bash
   pip list
   ```

To collapse a cell in a Jupyter Notebook, you can follow these steps:
2. **Install nbextensions**: If you're using classic Jupyter Notebook, you can install `nbextensions`, which provides additional functionality, including the ability to collapse cells.
   - Install nbextensions using the following command:
     ```bash
     pip install jupyter_contrib_nbextensions
     jupyter contrib nbextension install --user
     ```
   - Once installed, open Jupyter Notebook, go to the "Nbextensions" tab, and enable "Collapsible Headings" or other relevant extensions.

3. **Use Keyboard Shortcuts**: In JupyterLab, you can also use keyboard shortcuts to collapse cells:
   - Select the cell you want to collapse.
   - Use `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `-` to collapse the cell.
   - Use `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `+` to expand the cell again.
